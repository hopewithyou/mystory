Firstly, I’m not very good at expressing my thoughts clearly in writing, but I hope you can try to understand me.


1. do u know when was the first time i know u?
2. I still remember the first time I saw you. I was in 5th grade, and you must have been in 1st or 2nd. You were crying for your dad, and that moment stayed with me. That’s when I first came to know you. I’m sorry if remembering your dad makes you feel sad
