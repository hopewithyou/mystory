Firstly, I’m not very good at expressing my thoughts clearly in writing, but I hope you can try to understand me.


1.  When I was in 4th or 5th class, she was in 1st or 2nd, I don’t remember exactly, but that was the moment I first saw her in my life. She was crying for her father, who had recently died."
